    <h1>Introduction of Technology</h1>

    <p><strong>What technology did the team choose?</strong></p>
    <p>Our team chose to research generative AI.</p>

    <p><strong>Provide a good introduction to what the chosen technology is.</strong></p>
    <p>Generative AI is an AI language model that uses learning to generate data in a way that mimics human interaction. It is commonly used for generating text, videos, images, and even audio.</p>

    <p><strong>Why did the team choose it? (in other words, why does the tech matter?).</strong></p>
    <p>We chose this topic because we all had a vested interest in the concept of the ethics involved in generative AI. It is well known now that technologies such as ChatGPT and Google Bard are very useful tools, but can there be some areas that cause a second look when it comes to using them ethically? Or, can they be developed to stay in line with societal ethics?</p>
