            <p><strong>AI Art Generators for Complex Artworks</strong></p>
            <p>AI is being used for art creation. Artists are using AI to quickly generate a large number of potential designs, from which they can select and modify to create their final artwork. This method enables them to create new work more efficiently, particularly for intricate pieces like multi-layered textile patternsâ€‹. After generating these designs, artists can peruse this plethora of choices, selecting the ones that best align with their vision or spark new creative ideas. This phase is critical as it melds the artist's creative judgment with the AI's generative capabilities, ensuring the final artwork is a fusion of human artistic sensibility and algorithmic efficiency. Artists then have the flexibility to modify and refine these designs, adjusting elements like texture, layering, and color balance. This step is crucial in ensuring that the final piece not only harnesses the AI's capabilities but also embodies the artist's unique skills and vision.

            <p><strong>Generative AI in Music Composition: OpenAI's MuseNet.</strong></p>
            <p>OpenAI's MuseNet: Developed by OpenAI, MuseNet is capable of composing AI-generated musical pieces. It can pivot between music genres, including up to 10 instruments in tracks. This tool allows both professional musicians and casual music lovers to craft distinctive tracks by mixing and matching musical elements.</p>
            <p>One of the most striking features of MuseNet is its versatility in pivoting between various music genres. Users can seamlessly blend classical with jazz, rock with electronic, or experiment with any other genre combination, leading to the creation of unique and innovative musical pieces. This flexibility is not only a boon for professional musicians seeking new forms of inspiration and experimentation in their work but also for amateurs and music lovers who wish to explore music creation without the need for extensive knowledge in music theory or proficiency in playing instruments.</p>

            <p><strong>Challenges in application</strong></p>
            <p>For the AI generation creating art and music, one of the biggest ethical concern is authenticity. Music and art are inherently human things, and have been created by humans for thousands of years, so would music and art being generated by AI do fine arts justice? Well, considering that arts require a degree of creativity, something that is artificial in AI, that concern of whether or not generative art is authentic, is very real. Another thing that the creation of art requires is personal expression, which, as it says in the name, is personal. It is and has always been a way for humans to express emotion in a healthy manner.
